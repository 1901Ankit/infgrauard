                    Managed Service Providers are into providing IT services on
                    a contract basis. Managed Services is relatively a new
                    business model which takes a strategic approach to IT
                    management. This type of business model includes contract
                    and services that are agreed by both the parties and this
                    will vary from client to client. The service agreement
                    between MSP and the client covers specific areas and tasks
                    with some key performance indicators included in the
                    agreement.

                    Managed Services has been a fruitful model as it provides
                    more stability for clients on an ongoing basis and is less
                    expensive in the long run. MSPs is more widely used these
                    days as companies are moving to cloud and digitising their
                    operations. With MSPs, you can manage your cloud servers,
                    patch management, security and compliance updates.

                    Infraguard’s client wanted to enhance their Managed Services
                    Automation. The client is involved in executing a variety of
                    cloud migration projects and with the creative and
                    innovative solutions came the sets of actions that were
                    repeated across. So, the solution to this is one single
                    server management that was easy to learn and can be worked
                    across different providers and Operating Systems with

                    Infraguard was able to replace multiple software as well as
                    repeated manual processes were removed, which stands as a
                    hurdle in scalability. The client created a group
                    organization unit within Infraguard. This enabled them to
                    create multiple, fully-segregated client accounts. This also
                    sorted the employee assignment to one or multiple client
                    accounts. With successful set up of the structure, roles and
                    policies for each personnel was defined and enforced. Once
                    it is set up, Patch Management is performed.
